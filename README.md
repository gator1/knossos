Given a history of operations by a set of clients, and some singlethreaded
model, attempts to show that the history is not linearizable with respect to
that model. I am not certain the algorithm is correct yet; you should treat its
results as plausible but verify by hand.

Named after the ruins where the Linear B script was discovered. You know,
because we're testing if the history "be linear". YES IT'S A HISTORY PUN WORK
WITH ME HERE OKAY?

See `knossos.linear` for the linearizability checker, and `knossos.core` for an alternate approach.

Read the [blog
post](http://aphyr.com/posts/309-knossos-redis-and-linearizability) for a full apology for releasing this monstrosity.
